Deterministic voice control for Home Assistant — **67 languages**, on-device, no cloud. Assist alternative: **100% vs 31.3%** on 9,922 DE/EN household sentences ([benchmark](docs/en/benchmark-assist.md)). Klar executes house commands; an LLM only talks.

**Household path:** [Getting started](docs/en/getting-started.md) — install the pieces below → expose entities → Assist pipeline → five phrases → Mapping. If something misses: [troubleshooting](docs/en/troubleshooting.md).

**Breaking V2:** HTTP parse is only `POST /api/v2/parse` (`schema_version: "2.0"`). Upgrade the Rust engine and the Home Assistant integration together. `POST /api/parse` is gone. Existing `klar_nlu.json` overlays still load; `klar migrate import --from` dry-runs conflicts, orphans, and unsafe settings before a V2 save.

Every compiled Assist locale is first-class. German and English are hand-written reference packs and useful examples; generated packs use the same path. See [languages](docs/en/languages.md).

```
“Licht im Wohnzimmer an”     →  HassTurnOn   area=wohnzimmer  domain=light
“Set the garage door to 40%” →  HassSetPosition  cover.garage_door
“Spiel Queen” / “Play Queen” →  Music Assistant search-and-play
```

## What Klar NLU does

- Home commands: lights, climate, covers, locks, fans, media (including Music Assistant), timers, lists, scenes
- Multiple clauses (`living room and kitchen`, `turn the lights off and set heat to 21`)
- Clarification when a device is ambiguous
- Session: “turn it off” refers to the last target
- Personalities in the Klar operator UI (butler, grumpy, pirate, …) — Assist, the spoken cue, and the optional LLM rewrite all follow the same choice
- Optional LLM fallback in Home Assistant for chit-chat once Klar sees no home command
- Optional LLM refine of finished NLU replies (off by default; device control stays with Klar)

Klar NLU drives devices itself. An LLM only talks or rewrites speech — it does not run home intents.

## Home Assistant

Klar is two pieces. They do different jobs. Installing both does **not** make parsing more accurate.

| Piece | Role | Install it if… |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **HACS integration** | Conversation agent for Assist: syncs rooms/devices, runs intents | You want Assist to use Klar (always) |
| **App (add-on)** | Runs the NLU engine in its own container and serves Mapping / Lab | You are on Home Assistant OS and want that UI |
| **Bundled engine** | Same integration downloads the GitHub Release and starts the engine inside Core | You have no App (Container / Core, or HAOS without the App) |

Pick **one** engine host. Do not run the App and the bundled engine together.

- **Home Assistant OS:** install **both** — HACS for Assist, the App for the engine and Mapping/Lab. Sidebar **Klar NLU** is the App; Lovelace **Klar** is only the last Assist turn.
- **No Supervisor:** HACS only, and keep **Start the bundled engine (HACS only)** at setup.
- **App without HACS:** Mapping/Lab can open, but Assist will not use Klar.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=FABBricate-IT-Solutions&repository=klar-ha-nlu&category=integration)

1. Click the badge, or in HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories add `https://github.com/FABBricate-IT-Solutions/klar-ha-nlu` as **Integration**
2. Download **Klar NLU** and restart Home Assistant
3. On Home Assistant OS, also add the [App repository](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFABBricate-IT-Solutions%2Fklar-ha-nlu), install **Klar NLU**, and start it
4. [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=klar_nlu) — with the App running pick **Use the Klar NLU App or Docker**; without it pick **Start the bundled engine (HACS only)**
5. Expose the devices you want to talk to (Settings → Voice assistants → Expose)
6. Assist pipeline: conversation engine = **Klar NLU**
7. Personality, LLM, and refine live in the Klar NLU App / operator Settings — not in the Home Assistant options form

Release candidates: Configure → **Release channel** → Staging. That points at `http://klar-nlu-staging:10520` or the latest GitHub prerelease. Stable goes back to `http://klar-nlu:10520`. See [releases](docs/en/releases.md).

### Docker

Pin the image tag to the engine CalVer (same as `Cargo.toml` / the GitHub Release). Current tree: **2026.9.5**.

```bash
docker run --rm --network host \
  -v /path/to/homeassistant/config:/config:ro \
  ghcr.io/fabbricate-it-solutions/klar-nlu:2026.9.5
```

Integration URL: `http://127.0.0.1:10520`. Images also exist per arch (`klar-nlu-amd64`, `klar-nlu-aarch64`). RC images: tag `staging`.

Manual install: copy `custom_components/klar_nlu` to `config/custom_components/klar_nlu`, then restart.

## How it is organized

The Rust engine is split into clear layers:

- `src/types/` defines intents, `ParseOutcome`, settings, and the home graph.
- `src/nlu/` ranks candidates and applies confidence, OOD, confirm, and multi-intent policy.
- `src/parse/` tokenizes, detects actions, resolves targets, and fills slots.
- `src/home/` loads Home Assistant registries, overlays, expose data, roles, and the built-in sample home.
- `src/eval/` and `src/migrate.rs` own held-out scorecards and the one-shot V1 overlay import.
- `src/io/` owns HTTP, Wyoming, shared runtime state, token handling, and reloads.

At runtime Klar NLU builds one effective home graph from the HA config and the writable data directory. The parse API and Wyoming server share that graph and the same session store, so follow-ups behave the same on both interfaces.

## Quick start (from source)

Rust 1.85+, then:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --config-dir /path/to/ha-config --http 0.0.0.0:10520 --wyoming 0.0.0.0:10500
```

Without an HA config Klar NLU uses a built-in sample home.

| Port  | Service                 |
|-------|-------------------------|
| 10520 | Web UI and parse API    |
| 10500 | Wyoming intent          |

UI: <http://127.0.0.1:10520> — React operator UI (Home, Conversations, Rules, House / Mapping, Lab, Settings).

Useful checks while developing:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo check
cargo nextest run
cargo run --quiet -- lang validate packs
cargo run --quiet -- eval bench --repeat 8
cargo build --release
```

Do not run `scripts/lang_packs/generate.py` in pre-commit. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

Changelogs come from [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, …). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Every merge to `main` bumps the [Home Assistant CalVer](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/versioning/) (`YYYY.M.PATCH`), writes the changelog, and tags. The Build workflow then attaches linux-x86_64 and linux-aarch64 tarballs to the GitHub Release. **Actions → Release → Run workflow** remains for a manual override. A manual `git tag 2026.8.0 && git push origin 2026.8.0` still works.

Dependabot opens weekly PRs for crates and Actions; `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny` run on every change.

## Tests

```bash
cargo nextest run
```

The enforced voice-suite gates are documented in
[docs/en/testing.md](docs/en/testing.md); 100% remains the target, but the
current blocking thresholds are lower for the generated comparison suites.

## Credits

This project was vibe coded. If you want an English-first Home Assistant NLU from someone who is patient and puts more care into that language, use [Sophia NLU](https://nlu.to/ha/) by Aquila Labs. Klar’s English `family_home` voice tests come from their public MIT [HA voice test suite](https://git.cicero.sh/aquila/ha-voice-test-suite/); see [tests/datasets/NOTICE](tests/datasets/NOTICE).
